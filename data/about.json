You wonâ€™t find any of that here! This app is focused primarily on helping you understand the subject, with profit being a secondary concern."

    "value": "The application was designed to maximize learning efficiency. The best way to achieve this is by testing acquired knowledge. To prove that these aren't just empty words, I will present an analysis showing that tests help in learning. <br></br>In 2006, a study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of learning strategies. The study participants were divided into two groups. Both groups conducted a reading session, but afterward, one group continued reading while the other took a test. After 5 minutes, everyone took a test. The group that had two reading sessions performed slightly better than the group that had one reading session and one test. This makes sense, as they had more time for studying. <br></br> Things got more interesting when both groups took a test two days later. At that point, the group that spent less time reading and more time testing their knowledge performed significantly better. On the test conducted a week later, this difference became even more pronounced. How can this paradox be explained?"

While this makes sense if understanding one topic requires understanding another, when learning two unrelated topics, this method is not effective. Why? <br></br> This method creates an \"illusion of mastery,\" where learners feel confident in the material because they repeat the same task over and over. However, the brain adapts too quickly to the repetitive nature of the exercise, which diminishes deeper learning. Without forcing the brain to retrieve information in different contexts, learners don't strengthen the mental pathways needed for long-term recall. In contrast, techniques like `interleaved practice` (switching between different topics or skills) are more effective because they engage the brain in more challenging ways, forcing it to continually adapt and recall information. This leads to better problem-solving abilities and more flexible knowledge application. So \"Random Question\" is not another useless feature but it was added to promote more effective learning habits."
