        "value": "Since the inception of the Internet in the late 1960s, its evolution led to the creation of the very first web browser, Mosaic, in 1992. However, Mosaic could only present static HTML content. Recognizing the need for better web experiences, the mid-1990s witnessed the introduction of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to enhance the visual appearance of web browsers, allowing developers to separate the structure and presentation of web pages. Despite these improvements, web pages remained static, lacking interaction with users. To address this limitation, the creators of Mosaic, Netscape, sought to incorporate a scripting language into their new browser, Netscape Navigator. Two approaches were considered: embedding Java into the browser or developing a new language. The latter option proved successful, leading to the hiring of Brendan Eich to create a brand new scripting language. In a remarkable feat, Brendan Eich accomplished this task in just 10 days, bringing JavaScript to life in 1995. Originally named Mocha, JavaScript was crafted as a dynamically typed language with syntax resembling Java. Its purpose was to inject a high level of interactivity into web pages by granting developers the ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), representing the structure of an HTML document. Subsequently, the name Mocha was transformed to LiveScript in September 1995, and in December 1995, it underwent another change to JavaScript. This decision was driven by marketing considerations, aiming to leverage the rising popularity of Java at that time."

Simultaneously, Macromedia's ActionScript, developed for creating interactive content in Adobe Flash, contributed to multimedia-rich web applications. The competition between JavaScript and JScript led to efforts to standardize web scripting languages, resulting in the formation of the European Computer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) committee. It later established TC-39, a technical committee responsible for the ongoing development and standardization of ECMAScript, the official specification for JavaScript and similar languages."

Its purpose was to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling, making it easier for developers to write cross-browser JavaScript code. Even though it is not as popular as it used to be (mainly because JS evolved and became easier to use, so jQuery is no longer needed), the majority of websites is still powered by it."

It utilizes the V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side execution and unifying the language for both client and server tasks. With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js excels in handling concurrent connections, making it efficient for real-time applications. The npm package manager facilitates easy access to a vast array of open-source libraries, fostering a thriving ecosystem."

A few months later, Google unveiled AngularJS â€” a robust JavaScript framework designed for building dynamic web applications. AngularJS provided a comprehensive solution for client-side development, boasting features such as two-way data binding and dependency injection. Three years down the line, Facebook introduced a new framework named React, which brought forth a component-based architecture for constructing user interfaces. React rapidly gained popularity due to its efficiency and flexibility in developing intricate and interactive web applications."

After ECMAScript 2015, JavaScript swiftly evolved through ES7, ES8, and beyond, introducing enhanced features for a more modern development experience. The rise of progressive web applications (PWAs) heightened the demand for responsive solutions, leading to increased prominence of frameworks like Vue.js and Svelte, alongside React and Angular."
