This includes everything that is displayed in a web browser, such as the page layout, buttons, forms, text, images, as well as interactions such as clicking buttons, page navigation, animations, etc. <br></br>If you want to become a front-end developer, in addition to knowledge of JavaScript, you will also need knowledge of HTML and CSS. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) describes the content and structure of a web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the presentation and layout of the web page, controlling aspects like colors, fonts, and spacing. JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, enabling features like animations, form validations, and interactive content. Once you have mastered these technologies, you can start learning one of the frameworks described below:"

Each component represents a part of the user interface, and they can be combined together to create complex layouts. Components can be either class-based or function-based, with function components being more commonly used in modern React applications. Therefore, React forces us to use the functional programming paradigm."

It is an object that stores dynamic data within a component, allowing it to track values that may change over time, such as user input, the current view, or data fetched from an API. Every time the state is updated, the component re-renders in response to the change. This reactive behavior is where the name `React` comes from."
