The backend is the part of an app that handles server-side logic and database interactions, essentially managing everything that happens behind the scenes. It includes server configuration, database management, authentication, and business logic that powers the front-end. The backend processes client requests, communicates with databases to store or retrieve data, and sends responses back to the front-end. <br></br>To become a backend JavaScript developer, you'll also need knowledge of databases (SQL and NoSQL), API design, and server management are crucial. Backend development involves setting up and maintaining server infrastructure, managing application data, and ensuring security and performance of your applications. But the most important thing on your path to becoming a backend developer is mastering Node.js or another runtime environment."

Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side scripting, enabling them to build scalable and high-performance applications. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it particularly suited for building real-time applications like chat systems and live streaming services. Node.js also has a robust ecosystem, with a vast number of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager). No other language can boast having more free libraries. <br></br>Node.js has already been adopted by many companies, among others: PayPal, Netflix, NASA, LinkedIn, Reddit or eBay. It can successfully compete with other major technologies used to build backend systems. After PayPal switched to Node.js the speed of its webapp increased by 35%. <br></br>Despite all of that, Node.js has some drawback that were once discussed by the very creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl:"

It provides a straightforward API for handling routing and middleware, making it an excellent choice for developers who want to quickly set up a server or create an API. While it is flexible and has a vast ecosystem of plugins and extensions, it offers only basic functionality out of the box, which means developers might need to integrate additional tools for more complex needs. Its simplicity makes it ideal for small to medium-sized applications, but it may not handle high-load scenarios as efficiently as newer frameworks."

Fastify is highly extensible with support for plugins and hooks, making it a strong choice for applications requiring high performance. However, its focus on modern JavaScript practices and performance might steepen a learning curve for developers new to the framework. Additionally, its smaller ecosystem compared to Express might limit third-party integrations."

NestJS uses dependency injection for managing service lifecycles and dependencies and runs on top of Express by default, though it can also use Fastify. While it is optimized for TypeScript, NestJS can be used with JavaScript as well. Its feature-rich approach is beneficial for large-scale projects but may present a steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with advanced concepts such as dependency injection and TypeScript."
