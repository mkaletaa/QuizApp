First released in 2015, React Native allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms, while providing a native-like user experience. Moreover, you can build web, desktop and TV apps with it! If you already know React (see the `frontend` lesson) you also know 95% of React Native. Many libraries from React ecosystem are compatible with RN as well. Many big tech companies build their products using React Native. For example apps like Facebook, Messenger, MS Teams, Pinterest, Discord and many more exist thanks to this framework. Even the one you are currently on. This proves JavaScript is absolutely everywhere."
