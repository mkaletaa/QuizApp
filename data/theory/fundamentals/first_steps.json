Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through previously entered commands. To clear the console, press <ins class=''>Ctrl+L</ins> (Windows/Linux) or <ins class=''>Cmd+K</ins> (Mac)."

For example: <ins class=''>node my_file.js</ins>. This executes the JavaScript code present in the specified file and displays the output in the terminal. This method is particularly useful for running more extensive programs. If you use VS Code, you can run JavaScript code using built-in features or extensions. Right-click anywhere in the code editor and select <ins class=''>Run Code</ins> or use the keyboard shortcut <ins class=''>Ctrl+Alt+N</ins>. This will open a terminal at the bottom of VS Code, displaying the code execution results."
